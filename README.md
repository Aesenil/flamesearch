# flamesearch
A tool for automating the search for specific skills when choosing pawns in RimWorld

The GUI is meant to sit on top of the game window, and is made to nearly perfectly replicate the look of the menu in game.
Selecting too many options can lead to slow or indefinite wait times, as the more specific options selected, the less likely they'll all perfectly line up.
